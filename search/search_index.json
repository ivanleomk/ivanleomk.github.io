Some of the content here is paraphrased and I suggest going to the source for the best understanding.</p> <p>What is a transformer? Normally today, when we talk about transformers, we're refering to GPTs - Generative Pre-Trained Transformers. These are huge models that have billions of parameters and are trained on lots of data. This enables them to be able to have an underlying understanding of language.</p> <p>How do they do this? You can think of a transformer as having the following function signature where</p> <ul> <li><code>n_seq</code>: This is the size of the initial data passed in. It has to be less than or equal to the context length.</li> <li><code>n_vocab</code>: Our transformer outputs a prob distribution for each character in the input + the new predicted output.</li> </ul> <pre><code>def gpt(inputs: list[int]) -&gt; list[list[float]]: # inputs has shape [n_seq]\n# output has shape [n_seq, n_vocab]\n    output = # beep boop neural network magic\n    return output\n</code></pre> <p>A big part of this magic happens because of the self-attention mechanism, which gives transformers their special powers but also increases the time needed to make a prediction.</p>"},{"location":"blog/a-guide-to-rwkv-v3.html#attention-and-why-it-sucks","title":"Attention and Why it sucks","text":"<p>Some parts of this explanation are from Code Emporium's Excellent explanation on Transformers which you can view here</p> <p>The most important to take away from this section is that Attention scales quadratically. That's the single biggest bottleneck when we want to scale transformers to do more things.</p> <p>Let's see a graphical representation of what that might look like</p> <p></p> <p>A few things here to point out</p> <ol> <li> <p>Each word never sees a word that's beyond it's position. In the context of GPT when we are doing next token prediction, we don't the model to \"see the future\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Every single word prior to a word is compared against it to determine its relevancy to predicting the next word.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In our example above,</p> <ul> <li>What is compared to What (1 comparison )</li> <li>Is is compared to What and Is ( 2 comparisons )</li> <li>My is compared to What,Is and My ( 3 comparisons )</li> <li>Name is compared to What, Is, My and Name ( 4 comparisons )</li> </ul> <p>In some cases, (1) might not hold (Eg. in Translation) where grammar structures differ between languages but for a GPT, this is normally the case.</p> <p>because (2) is happening, then this means that the number of comparisons for a string that has been broken down into <code>n</code> tokens is going to be</p> \\[ 1 + 2 + \\dots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\] <p>which is quadratic in nature. This is an oversimplification of attention but you get the idea. That's why it gets more and more costly as we expand our models context sizes because there are simply more comparisons to be made.</p> <p>We cannot cache these previous lookups in a transformer. This is one of the biggest problems with Transformers that RWKV doesn't have as you'll see down below.</p> <p>In transformers, the self-attention mechanism computes query, key, and value vectors for each word in the input sequence and uses the dot product of these vectors to determine the attention scores. This process is sensitive to the specific tokens in the input sequence, and as a result, caching the attention scores for one sequence may not be applicable to a subsequent sequence.</p>"},{"location":"blog/a-guide-to-rwkv-v3.html#rwkv","title":"RWKV","text":"<p>RWKVs aim to solve the issue of attention by approximating attention with a linear operation instead. This results in 1-1.5x cheaper training costs and around 10x cheaper inference costs, especially as the number of tokens passed into the model increase over time.</p> <p>We can see this with the following graphic from the RWKV paper that shows how the inference cost grows with respect to the token count.

The platform's constraints actually encourage more thoughtful design choices, focusing energy on creating meaningful content rather than wrestling with technical implementation.</p> <p>For applications like training simulations, customer service practice, or voice interfaces requiring quick deployment, success depends on thoughtful design that considers the specific skills being developed, the context needed for authentic experiences, and the strategic introduction of variability to build adaptability.</p> <p>The most valuable insight from this project is that voice agents aren't a panacea - they're a tool that requires deliberate planning and user empathy to create truly effective experiences. With careful context design, strategic randomization, and skill-targeted scenarios, voice applications can create powerful, immersive learning experiences that translate directly to real-world skills.</p>"},{"location":"blog/understanding-user-conversations.html","title":"Using Language Models to make sense of Chat Data without compromising user privacy","text":"<p>If you're interested in the code for this article, you can find it here where I've implemented a simplified version of CLIO without the PII classifier and most of the original prompts ( to some degree ).</p> <p>Analysing chat data at scale is a challenging task for 3 main reasons</p> <ol> <li>Privacy - Users don't want their data to be shared with others and we need to respect that.

Since the choice of <code>k</code> directly impacts how well clusters capture distinct conversational patterns, we need to be more careful here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Basic PII Removal : In Anthropic's case, they have a specific PII classifier that they use to remove PII. However, this is a very basic classifier that only looks at the user request and task description. A production system should invest time into building out a more sophisticated PII classifier that can be used to remove PII from the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>More Concrete Evaluations: Ultimately, if you're looking to implement CLIO, you'll want to have a more concrete evaluation framework in place. This will allow you to measure the quality of your clusters and ensure that you're getting the most out of your data. Anthropic does this by using a combination of manual validation and synthetic data generation but you should also validate manually that the clusters are meaningful and that the PII is removed.

Compare this to an RNN which processes each input token incrementally. This meant that we could scale our datasets to much larger sizes, allow our model to learn better representations of data and in turn make better predictions.</li> <li>By splitting up the generated representation using multi-head attention, we can allow our model to learn to process different semantic meaning in each subset of the vector. This means that we could extract much richer representations.</li> </ol> <p>This is on a high level how attention works</p> <p></p> <p>We basically take our input representation and multiply it with three separate matrices and get back three new matrices. These are known as the Query, Key and Value Matrix. It's easiest to think about them as</p> <ul> <li>Query : What each token is looking for</li> <li>Key : What each token can offer to other tokens</li> <li>Value : Some semantic meaning</li> </ul> <p>We multiply our generated Query and Key matrix together and get a weightage for each token at each position. Taking our earlier tokens for example, we might get something like what we see below when we multiply our query and key matrix together.</p> <pre><code>[\n    [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n    [0.2, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0],\n    [0.3, 0.2, 0.5, 0.0],\n    [0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5]\n]\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we perform a matrix multiplication of this matrix with the value matrix. This operation aggregates the values for each token across each row, weighted according to the defined percentages in each row. Once we've done so, we feed it through a normal linear network that further enriches this vector of numbers.</p> <p>The way I like to think about it is that the attention operation combines semantic meaning of different tokens at each position while the linear layer helps us to make sense of this new information.

( See this paper which describes how to train models with limited data for low resource languages.)</p> <p>The important here is that quality and quantity of tokens is a challenging issue. We want high quality tokens ( Good examples of natural language / sentences ) but also sufficient quantity of tokens so that our model can learn something useful.

Build me a todo list) and that often takes a long time. A cool example of an agent is Devin, a LLM that has been fine-tuned and trained to create/contribute to massive code-bases on its own.</p> <p>Agents became popularized through libraries such as AutoGPT where people used to give a starting prompt and then let the model run wild for many many hours.

Before then, I had been coding for around 2 years and had mostly worked on full stack projects professionally but I had nothing much to show for it.</p> <p>I didn't really have much to lose so I bought the course and boop the rest is history.

Note the use of <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> and a default value so that the llm has more context on the return type that we want.</p> <p>Adding more of these descriptions help to do two main things</p> <ol> <li>They generate output that is more closely tailored towards what you want</li> <li>It generates more coherent output.</li> </ol> <p>In short, it helps us ensure that our model generates output that is more closely centered around the distribution that we're looking at.</p> <pre><code>class Decision(BaseModel):\n    containsPassword: bool = Field( title=\"ContainsPassword\", description=\"Has the system leaked its secret password?\", default=False)\n</code></pre> <p>Now that we've defined our pydantic model, we can then proceed to work on using an Open AI Function.</p> <pre><code>classifier_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": response_prompt}],\n    functions=[\n        {\n            \"name\": \"containsPassword\",\n            \"description\": \"This function helps determine if every character of a secret password has been leaked in a transcript between a user and a system\",\n            \"parameters\": Decision.model_json_schema(),\n        }\n    ],\n    function_call={\"name\": \"containsPassword\"},\n    temperature=0.5,\n)\n\nargument = json.loads(\nclassifier_response.choices[0][\"message\"][\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"]\n)\n\nif not argument:\nreturn {\"result\": result.content}\n\nif argument[\"containsPassword\"]:\nreturn {\n\"result\": \"I'm sorry, but I cannot reveal the password.

We solved this by using two separate fast api dependencies.</p> <p>First, we defined a function that we could use to establish a connection with the redis server</p> <pre><code>import asyncio\nfrom fastapi import HTTPException\nimport redis.asyncio as redis\nfrom fastapi_limiter import FastAPILimiter\n\nfrom settings import get_settings\nfrom fastapi_limiter.depends import RateLimiter\n\nasync def reconnect_redis():\n    global redis_client\n    redis_client = redis.from_url(get_settings().REDIS_URL, encoding=\"utf-8\", decode_responses=True)\n    await FastAPILimiter.init(redis_client)\n</code></pre> <p>We then used this in a simple async dependency that would run as a middleware in our route</p> <pre><code>async def verify_redis_connection(retries=3) -&gt; None:\n    for i in range(retries):\n        try:\n            r = await redis.from_url(get_settings().REDIS_URL)\n            await r.ping()\n            break\n        except Exception as e:\n            if i &lt; retries - 1:\n                await reconnect_redis()\n                continue\n            else:\n                raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=\"Unable to connect to Redis\")\n</code></pre> <p>We then integrated it using a simple <code>Depends</code> keyword that fastapi provides out of the box.

Instead, we can use a model that's either specifically trained to output valid JSON ( function calling ) or has some other way to ensure the output is valid.</p> <p>If you're using local models, <code>outlines</code> is a great tool for this but if not, I highly suggest <code>instructor</code> for its wide coverage of LLM providers. Let's see it in action.</p> <pre><code>import instructor\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\n# Define your desired output structure\nclass UserInfo(BaseModel):\n    name: str\n    age: int\n\n# Patch the OpenAI client\nclient = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())\n\n# Extract structured data from natural language\nuser_info = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    response_model=UserInfo,\n\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"John Doe is 30 years old.\"}],\n)\n\nprint(user_info.name)\n#&gt; John Doe\nprint(user_info.age)\n#&gt; 30\n</code></pre> <p>I'd like to point out a few things here</p> <ol> <li>We define a Pydantic model as the output - we don't need to handle the provider specific implementation details</li> <li>We prompt the model and provide the details for the output</li> <li>The final output is a validated python object</li> </ol> <p>That's a lot of value already! We don't need to do any prompting to get this behaviour. Yes, our model might struggle with more complex structures but for most response types that have at most 1-2 layers of nesting, most modern models will do a great job.</p> <p>This is great for 3 main reasons</p> <ol> <li>Wide Support : All major providers support structured outputs in some form. OpenAI has its structured outputs, Google's Gemini has its function calling while Anthropic has its tool use</li> <li>Reliability : By working with models and systems trained to output valid JSON, we can avoid the pitfalls of complex prompting. Better yet, by using a library like <code>instructor</code>, we can experiment with different response models and see how they perform. Function Calling is much more consistent and reliable than JSON mode from experiments I've ran.</li> <li>Metrics : Structured outputs give you your first real metrics - success rate. You'll frequently find that this is where Open Source models start to struggle a bit sometimes (Eg. Llama-3.1-70b) relative to closed source models that have infrastructure in place around them.</li> </ol> <p>This makes it easy to integrate existing LLM calls into existing systems and workflows that we've built over time, log data in a structured format and remove a class of parsing errors that we'd otherwise have to deal with.</p> <p>And all it took was just a simple <code>response_model</code> parameter and a <code>.from_openai</code> method.</p>"},{"location":"blog/taming-your-llm-application.html#prioritizing-iteration","title":"Prioritizing Iteration","text":"<p>A LLM system is a complex beast with a lot of parts.

Good metrics here to consider are recall and mrr.</p> <p>Most importantly, we can use these queries to test different approaches to retrieval because we can just run the same queries on each of them and see which performs the best. If we were comparing say - BM25, Vector Search and Vector Search with a Re-Ranker step, we can now identify what the impact on recall, mrr and latency is.</p> <p>Say we generate 100 queries and we find that we get the following results</p> Method Recall@5 Recall@10 Recall@15 BM25 0.72 0.78 0.82 Vector Search 0.75 0.81 0.85 Vector + Re-Ranker 0.69 0.75 0.79 <p>We might conclude that for an initial prototype, shipping with BM25 is sufficient because we can match the performance of the other two methods with a simpler system - see how recall@15 for BM25 here matches recall@10 for Vector Search. This means that we can go from absolute recomendations that people give (eg. The BAAI/bge-m3 model is the best model! ) to specific decisions that are unique to our data.</p> <p>But this doesn't just apply to retrieval itself, we can also use this to evaluate our choice of data ingestion method.</p> <p>Say we were comparing two methods of ingesting data - one that ingest the description of an item and another that ingests the item's description, its price and categories it belongs to. We can use the same set of queries to see which performs the best ( since the underlying chunk doesn't change, just the representation that we're using to embed it ).</p> <p>If we got the following reuslts</p> Method Recall@5 Recall@10 Recall@15 Description Only 0.72 0.78 0.82 Description + Price + Categories 0.79 0.86 0.90 <p>It's pretty clear here that the second method is better because we get ~10% increase in recall across 5,10 and 15. We've identified an easy win here that takes a small amount of time to implement.</p> <p>Most importantly, we can use these metrics to make a data driven decision about which approach to use. We're not going off some fuzzy \"I think this might work better\", we know that there's a quantitative objective difference. Since they're cheap and easy to calculate, you can run them multiple times without worrying about cost - locally while developing, in your CI/CD pipelines or even in production.</p> <p>But these aren't just for simple question answering tasks.

Robust testing helps identify these failure modes early, preventing potential issues in production.</li> <li>Performance Impact Assessment: Testing allows us to see how changes in prompts and function definitions affect the overall performance of our application.</li> </ol> <p>Without a good set of evaluations early in the development process, it's challenging to catch and address problems before they become deeply embedded in your application. Early testing enables iterative improvement and helps ensure the reliability of your LLM-powered features.</p> <p>With <code>instructor</code>, testing is simple because you can just verify that the language model has called the right function. I wrote about how to test applications in Rag Is More Than Just Vector Search in more detail. We can test our model performance by doing a simple assertion on the response.</p> <p>Let's see how we can do so with a simple example of a personal assistant with a few tools - google search, calculator and a messaging system.</p> <pre><code>from instructor import from_openai\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom typing import Union\nfrom rich import print\n\nclient = from_openai(OpenAI())\n\n\n# Pydantic\nclass GoogleSearch(BaseModel):\n    query: str\n\n\nclass Calculator(BaseModel):\n    calculations: list[str]\n\n\nclass MessageResponse(BaseModel):\n    message: str\n\n\ndef get_response(query: str):\n    resp = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n        messages=[\n            {\n                \"role\": \"system\",\n                \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.

This approach sets a strong foundation for more advanced evaluation techniques as your project grows in complexity.</p> <p>Additionally, <code>instructor</code> can integrate with any evaluation provider capable of wrapping the OpenAI client. This flexibility allows you to start with simple local tests and scale to more complex evaluation setups as needed. The simplicity of testing also means that it's easy to write tests early.</p> <p>We can imagine a slightly more complex test here where we want to check that the right parameters are passed to the tool. Because our tools here are just Pydantic models, we can also test them separately or chain on additional functionality by defining simple class methods.</p> <p>The closest equivalent I could find in Langchain was this example where they use langsmith to evaluate the intermediate steps of a chain where they evaluate the input and output of a tool call and use langsmith to evaluate the intermediate steps.</p> <p>It's a bit too complex for my liking and combines the retrieval and generation in a single step which I don't think is a good idea. I would have personally split this into a few different tests</p> <ol> <li>Testing that the right tool is called - there are some cases where we might not even want RAG to be used (Eg.

This ensures that we process our data quickly but also that we do so in the specific order that we want. A common problem in RAG is to read in documents, so let's see how we might be able to write a few generators to do the job.</p> <pre><code>from pathlib import Path\n\n\ndef read_files(path: Path, file_suffix: str):\n    for file in path.iterdir():\n        if file.suffix != file_suffix:\n            continue\n        yield {\"file\": file.name, \"content\": file.read_text()}\n\n\ndef chunk_text(documents):\n    for document in documents:\n        for chunk in document[\"content\"].split(\"\\n\"):\n            yield {\"chunk\": chunk, \"file\": document[\"file\"]}\n\n\ndef batch_items(items, batch_size=20):\n    batch = []\n    for item in items:\n        batch.append(item)\n        if len(batch) == batch_size:\n            yield batch\n            batch = []\n\n    if batch:\n        yield batch\n\n\nfiles = read_files(Path.cwd(), \"md\")\nchunks = chunk_text(files)\nbatches = batch_items(chunks)\n</code></pre> <p>Imagine if we had an incredibly large number of documents, we'd be waiting for every file to be read in and every chunk that we'd ever process to be loaded into memory before we even started batching items. With generators, we're able to both reason about the order that our data is consumed AND get the huge cost savings in execution time.</p>"},{"location":"blog/writing-scripts-that-scale.html#implement-logging","title":"Implement Logging","text":"<p>Logging doesn't have to be complex.

What you thought was great writing last month might not meet your standards today. When I first started working with language models for my writing, I discovered criteria I hadn't even considered. Some articles that I initially thought were good had issues I hadn't noticed before.</p> <p>This is where having a structured approach to maintaining prompts and examples becomes crucial. Instead of reinventing the wheel each time, you can refine your existing prompts and examples based on new insights. It's like maintaining a living style guide that evolves with your understanding.</p> <p>Regular review isn't just about checking old examples - it's about refining your understanding of quality. Each piece of feedback you get, whether criticism or praise, helps you develop sharper evaluation criteria.</p> <p>This process reveals blind spots in your own work. You might discover that your writing could be more concise, or that your code could be better structured. These insights improve everything you create.</p>"},{"location":"blog/youre-probably-using-llms-wrongly.html#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Working effectively with language models isn't about finding the perfect prompt or having advanced technical knowledge. It's about adopting a systematic approach focused on continuous improvement.</p> <p>By treating LLM interactions as an iterative process, building a library of strong examples, and regularly reviewing your work, you'll see dramatic improvements in output quality. These practices help bridge the gap between what you want and what the model delivers.</p> <p>As much as vibe checks are a meme, the only way we get better at working with language models is through practice. Vibe checks are just our initial gut feelings that we haven't systematized yet. The key is turning those gut feelings into concrete examples and criteria that you can use consistently.</p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2025.html","title":"2025","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2024.html","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2023.html","title":"2023","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/voice.html","title":"Voice","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/llm.html","title":"LLM","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/deployment.html","title":"Deployment","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/uiux.html","title":"UI/UX","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/llms.html","title":"LLMs","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/mcps.html","title":"MCPs","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/trends.html","title":"Trends","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/evals.html","title":"Evals","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/instructor.html","title":"Instructor","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/synthetic-data.html","title":"Synthetic Data","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/clustering.html","title":"Clustering","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/ai.html","title":"AI","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/personal.html","title":"Personal","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/advice.html","title":"Advice","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/career.html","title":"Career","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/machine-learning.html","title":"Machine Learning","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/personal-development.html","title":"Personal Development","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/modal.html","title":"Modal","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/diffusion-models.html","title":"Diffusion Models","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/comfyui.html","title":"ComfyUI","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/ai-engineering.html","title":"AI Engineering","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/debugging.html","title":"Debugging","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/testing.html","title":"Testing","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/evaluation.html","title":"Evaluation","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/documentation.html","title":"Documentation","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/mac.html","title":"Mac","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/rwkv.html","title":"RWKV","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/evaluations.html","title":"Evaluations","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/rag.html","title":"RAG","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/applied-ai.html","title":"Applied AI","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/langchain.html","title":"langchain","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/braintrust.html","title":"Braintrust","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/walkthrough.html","title":"Walkthrough","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/python.html","title":"Python","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/ui-generation.html","title":"UI Generation","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/whisper.html","title":"Whisper","text":""},{"location":"blog/page/2/index.html","title":"Index","text":""},{"location":"blog/page/3/index.html","title":"Index","text":""},{"location":"blog/page/4/index.html","title":"Index","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/page/2.html","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/page/3.html","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/llms/page/2.html","title":"LLMs","text":""}]}
