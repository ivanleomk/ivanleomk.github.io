Here are some articles I've written recently which might be of interest

1. [Synthetic data is not a free lunch](./blog/posts/synthetic-data-is-not-a-free-lunch.md) : Generating synthetic data requires careful thought and validation. Success comes from building robust pipelines that incorporate business logic and real-world constraints, not just volume.
2. [Running better experiments with LLMs](./blog/posts/running-better-experiments.md) : Three key factors for better LLM experiments: be clear about what you're varying, invest in infrastructure for fast feedback loops, and validate results with sensitivity testing.

3. [What goes behind the scenes of Instructor](./blog/posts/how-does-instructor-work.md) : A deep dive into how Instructor transforms unvalidated LLM calls into validated functions with type signatures using Pydantic models and OpenAI's function calling.

4. [How to use Braintrust for Evals](./blog/posts/braintrust-from-scratch.md) : A quick guide to setting up evaluation pipelines with Braintrust to test LLM performance, with examples using the GSM8k dataset.

5. [Is RAG dead?](./blog/posts/what-is-rag.md) : RAG isn't dead, we're just getting started with it.

6. [Write Stupid Evals](./blog/posts/write-stupid-evals.md) : Keep it simple and worry about the rest later.
